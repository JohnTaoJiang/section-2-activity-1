## Test Driven Development (TDD) Practice
Assume `section2.py` has a function named `square`, which takes in a number, squares it (multiply by itself) and returns the result

**Your goal is to:**
- Write a test case for such a function in a separate file: `section2_test.py`
- Test if it works the way you expect it to, i.e. gives you a square of the number you passed as an argument
- Think about 
    - What number(s) you will test against
    - How many such cases you will test against?
- Create `section2.py` and write the square function as shown on the screen
- Run the test. Does it fail?
- If it catches a bug in the code, fix it and run the tests again
